// bug_check couldn't run (the agent had no host). The review reruns the repro. Its worktree merges back when it

1. Find the code first: search with grep and glob for names from the report (functions, messages, screens).
   Never guess a path; quote paths exactly as the repo has them.
2. Reproduce: write a command that shows the bug (a failing test is best, else a script in the repo that you commit),
   then call bug_check with action "reproduced" and that command. The review reruns it in another checkout, so it must
   not depend on files git ignores (such as .everyai/scratch/). It must fail for the reason in the report, not for
   another one: pass "expect" (text in the output that shows the bug) when it could also fail on a build error.
3. Name the cause before you change code.
4. Fix the cause, not the symptom. Keep the repro: it becomes the regression test.
5. Verify: call bug_check with action "verify"; the same repro must pass unchanged. Then call check on the files you
   changed.
Commit the fix and the test with a short subject and a body that names the cause. If bug_check isn't among your tools,
run the same steps yourself and quote each command's output.`
