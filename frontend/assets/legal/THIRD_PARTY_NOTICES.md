### Libraries bundled inside `mermaid.min.js`

The Mermaid build bundles its dependencies into the same file, so the app
ships them too. The first three carry their notices inside the bundle (kept
there, unmodified); the rest are Mermaid 11.17.2's runtime dependencies.
Where a license below says "MIT", its text is the MIT license above with the
copyright line given here.

## LibreChat v0.8.8

## Excalidraw 0.18.1 and mermaid-to-excalidraw 3.1.0

- **What:** the Excalidraw editor (`@excalidraw/excalidraw@0.18.1`) and the
  Mermaid converter (`@excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw@3.1.0`, which uses
  `pele@1.8.0`), with React 19.2.5 (`react`, `react-dom`). They are not copied
  into the repository: the drawing page loads these pinned versions from
  jsDelivr (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/…/+esm`) inside the web sandbox, and
  Excalidraw's fonts come from the same package. Their own dependencies (also
  from jsDelivr) carry their own licenses.
- **Where:** `frontend/lib/features/artifacts/ui/renderers/drawing_page.dart`
- **License:** MIT, for each package, with these copyright lines:

  - mermaid-to-excalidraw: Copyright (c) 2023 Excalidraw

## Agent Skills `skills-ref` (agentskills/agentskills @ 69ef37e)

- **What:** the validation rules of the reference validator
  (`skills-ref/src/skills_ref/validator.py`, `parser.py`): the allowed front
  matter fields, the name rules (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens,
  at most 64 characters, matching the folder), and the description (1024) and
  compatibility (500) limits. Re-implemented in Dart; no code was copied.
- **Where:** `frontend/lib/features/skills/domain/skill_format.dart`
- **License:** Apache License 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),
  from https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills.

## Deno 2.9.8 (denoland/deno @ v2.9.8)

- **What:** the `deno` release binary, unmodified, from
  https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.9.8 (checked against the
  release's `.sha256sum`). The Code harness runs `run_script` programs in it
  with no permissions. The binary carries V8 and other components under their
  own licenses.
- **Where:** downloaded by `frontend/tool/fetch_deno.sh` into `frontend/.deno/`
  (`scripts/dev.sh` and `scripts/launch.sh` pass it as `DENO_BIN`); the macOS build copies it into
  `EveryAI.app/Contents/Resources/deno` (`frontend/macos/scripts/bundle_deno.sh`).
- **License:** MIT

```

## opencode v2.2 (anomalyco/opencode)

- **What:** the design of the EveryAI harness's tool set (read/write/edit with a
  read-before-edit check and a line-trimmed fallback match, grep/glob over
  ripgrep, background shells, the todo list), ported in Dart; no prompt text
  was copied.

## T3 Code (pingdotgg/t3code @ 8b44f42b)

- **What:** logic and protocol knowledge from T3 Code's provider adapters,
  rewritten in Dart (no files copied verbatim; no prompt text was taken). So
  far: Kiro CLI's ACP launch arguments (`--agent-engine=v3`,
  `--auth-method=cli`) and the reading of `kiro-cli whoami --format json`
  (`packages/provider-kiro/src/server/acpSupport.ts`, `status.ts`); Grok
  Build's ACP launch flags, `initialize`/`session/cancel` `_meta`, sign-in
  method pick and `grok models` sign-in reading
  (`packages/provider-grok/src/server/acpSupport.ts`, `status.ts`), and its
  `x.ai/*` extension mapping: prompt completion, background tasks,
  subagents, the usage-limit code (`xaiAcpExtension.ts`; test payloads
  adapted from `xaiAcpExtension.test.ts` in
  `frontend/test/fixtures/drivers/grok/`). The replies Grok reads are our
  own words. The ACP registry install rules: the index checks (https only,
  pinned npx/uvx packages, bounded fields, the 1 MiB cap), the command path
  check, the platform pick with its windows-aarch64 fallback, the archive
  kind by URL suffix, and the checksum and stays-inside checks of a
  download (`packages/provider-acp-registry/src/server/AcpRegistrySupport.ts`).

  from T3 Code", and `drivers/registry_install/`)

## Sparkle 2.9.6 (sparkle-project/Sparkle)

  release uses it to download, verify (EdDSA and code signature) and install its own updates.

  `UpdaterBridge` in `frontend/macos/Runner/MainFlutterWindow.swift`.
