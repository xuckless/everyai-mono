### Libraries bundled inside `mermaid.min.js`

The Mermaid build bundles its dependencies into the same file, so the app
ships them too. The first three carry their notices inside the bundle (kept
there, unmodified); the rest are Mermaid 11.17.2's runtime dependencies.
Where a license below says "MIT", its text is the MIT license above with the
copyright line given here.

## LibreChat v0.8.8

- **What:** the Mermaid SVG fix-up (`processMermaidSvg`, `applyMermaidBackground`,
  `fixSubgraphTitleContrast`) and the 2x canvas PNG export, ported from
  `client/src/utils/diagram/export.ts` and `client/src/utils/mermaid.ts`.

## Excalidraw 0.18.1 and mermaid-to-excalidraw 3.1.0

- **What:** the Excalidraw editor (`@excalidraw/excalidraw@0.18.1`) and the
  Mermaid converter (`@excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw@3.1.0`, which uses
  `pele@1.8.0`), with React 19.2.5 (`react`, `react-dom`). They are not copied
  into the repository: the drawing page loads these pinned versions from
  jsDelivr (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/…/+esm`) inside the web sandbox, and
  Excalidraw's fonts come from the same package. Their own dependencies (also
  from jsDelivr) carry their own licenses.
- **Where:** `frontend/lib/features/artifacts/ui/renderers/drawing_page.dart`
- **License:** MIT, for each package, with these copyright lines:
  - Excalidraw: Copyright (c) 2020 Excalidraw
  - mermaid-to-excalidraw: Copyright (c) 2023 Excalidraw
  - pele: Copyright (c) 2026 kepano
  - React: Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.

## Agent Skills `skills-ref` (agentskills/agentskills @ 69ef37e)

- **What:** the validation rules of the reference validator
  (`skills-ref/src/skills_ref/validator.py`, `parser.py`): the allowed front
  matter fields, the name rules (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens,
  at most 64 characters, matching the folder), and the description (1024) and
  compatibility (500) limits. Re-implemented in Dart; no code was copied.
- **Where:** `frontend/lib/features/skills/domain/skill_format.dart`
- **License:** Apache License 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),
  from https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills.

## OpenHands agent-server 1.59.0 (OpenHands/software-agent-sdk @ v1.59.0)

- **What:** the `agent-server` release binary, unmodified, from
  https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/releases/tag/v1.59.0
  (checked against the release's `SHA256SUMS`). The Code workspace runs it as
  a local process. The binary is a PyInstaller build and carries the Python
  runtime and packages it depends on, each under its own license.
- **Where:** downloaded by `frontend/tool/fetch_agent_server.sh` into
  `frontend/.agent-server/`; the macOS build copies it into
  `EveryAI.app/Contents/Resources/` (`frontend/macos/scripts/bundle_agent_server.sh`).
- **License:** MIT
