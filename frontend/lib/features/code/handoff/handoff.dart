// The handoff: what a new lead of a Code session gets when another harness
// took the work so far (the old one ran out of plan usage, or the user
// switched). Only facts, read from the session's events and the repository:
// no model is asked, so a handoff costs nothing (EveryAI spends nothing on a
// session it doesn't lead, and the outgoing lead may be out of usage). The
// new lead also gets the whole conversation as a Markdown file in the
// project's git-excluded `.everyai/handoffs/`, which it may read and
// summarise for itself, on its own plan.
//
// A turn the usage limit cut off is finished by the new lead: the handoff
// names the request, the calls that already ran (with their results) and
// the diff so far, so nothing is redone and the user repeats nothing.
//
// Going back to a harness that already has the earlier conversation gets a
// delta: only what happened since it last led. A delta that is too big, or a
// conversation that can't be reopened, gets a full handoff instead.
